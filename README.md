# scss_buttons
Automagic buttons.

An attempt at making button generation for a color theme dead simple.

##Things to do
- I'm not satisfied with defaulting the color to black. I feel like there is a more elegant solution to dynamically getting the color through some form of lightness/invert set up.

##Requirements
This assumes you're working with Zurb's Foundation 6 for Sites. This could be very easily tweaked for almost another framework/library, or one you rolled yourself.
